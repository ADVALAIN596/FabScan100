FabScan1.5
==========

This is basically just a small project where I try to combine the different libraies in one program on multiple platforms.
The Libraries I plan to use are the following:
* OpenGL - works on Mac, works on Ubuntu, not tested on Windows
* OpenCV - works on Mac, not tested on Ubuntu, not tested on Windows
* PCL - not tested on Mac, not tested on Ubunutu, not tested on Windows

Current Setup on Mac: Qt 4.7 with Qt-Creator 2.4

Current Setup on Ubuntu: Qt 4.8 with Qt-Creator 2.4.1

Current Setup on Windows: not tested, who wants to do this ?
